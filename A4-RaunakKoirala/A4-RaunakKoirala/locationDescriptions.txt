You've entered the cave. It'd dark and gloomy...
The fortification is massive and the bricks have serveral scratches...
You hear the calm sound of water, but as you get closer you notice something, the water flows dark red...
You arrive at a maze and navigate around great vines and obstacles...
Stench of bodies, all seem to be tiny...
You hear whispers and feel the shadows sorround you as you walk in...
Green everywhere, your skin is itching and you can hearly breathe...
You feel a warmth like never before, you must be getting close to the lair...
Fire, ashes, death...You've entered the Dragons home....
The air burns your skin, you must be close to the lair...
Skeltons of creatures never seen before, you could've swron you saw one moving...
Black mist covers the ground, watch where you walk...
Spooky corridor, at least there's light...
Fog fills the cave, feeling of despair looms...
Ancient ruins, carvings on the wall, maybe its a story written by the people who came before...
Freezing, you get shivers up and down your spine...
Beautiful crystals hang fromt he walls and ceiling but feel like your going to turn into an ice statue...
Large hole in a room, you can clearly see spikes at the bottom, a stench from it, people without a lantern must fallen in...
Some sort of burial ground, someone must've buried the bodies they found...
Steel bars, all locked, what they keep imprisoned doesn't look human...
